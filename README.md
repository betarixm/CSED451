 'Computer Graphics' is a POSTECH's class to understand the principles of graphic via math with OpenGL.
 This introductory course to graphics covers fundamental principles of 2D and 3D graphics. After introducing the basic concepts, such as geometric transformations, viewing, and hierarchical modeling, this course covers issues and techniques in three main areas of graphics, modeling, rendering, and animation. The specific topics include polygonal modeling and curves and surfaces in modeling, hidden surface removal, shading, and texture mapping in rendering, and key-frame animation in animation. Programming assignments using OpenGL and shaders will facilitate better understating of the concepts covered in the lecture.
